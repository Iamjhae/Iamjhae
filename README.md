Hello 
I'm JhaeArch (Arookiech on few platforms), a student, a hacker, a Security Researcher and aspiring Cybersecurity Specialist and Bug Hunter. Driven with a purpose, one day I'm gonna climb up the ladder and be heard. 👀 I’m interested in all sorts of Linux programming, python, cryptography, Penetration testing and bug bounty, 🌱 I’m currently learning, and 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on bug bounties 💪...
Not a pro, just a boy with big dreams
